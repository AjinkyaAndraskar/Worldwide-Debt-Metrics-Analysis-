# Worldwide-Debt-Metrics-Analysis-

- The World Bank functions as a provider of financial assistance to nations, facilitating their economic management through debt acquisition. An illustration of this is the funding directed towards infrastructure, a fundamental expenditure contributing to citizens' quality of life within a country.

- Within the context of this project, I have meticulously scrutinized the World Bank dataset through the formulation of SQL queries. These queries serve to address compelling inquiries pertaining to international debt. The dataset encompasses a comprehensive array of data concerning debt quantities (measured in USD) held by developing nations. The data spans from 1970 to 2015.

* The analysis conducted offers insights into various dimensions of international debt, and seeks to address inquiries like:

1. The cumulative debt sum attributed to the countries featured in the dataset.
2. Identification of the country with the highest debt ownership, along with the corresponding amount.
3. The mean debt value held by countries across diverse debt indicators.
* It is noteworthy that the dataset's origin lies with The World Bank, an esteemed source of national and regional debt statistics for numerous nations worldwide (source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/home).
